## About
I am a postdoctoral fellow at Polytechnique Montreal where my research seeks to expand how ultrasound diagnostics can be used to make inferences on neurological diseases. My focus is to develop new super-resolution ultrasound imaging techniques to probe the neurovasculature beyond the skull. 

Before, I completed my PhD in Biomedical Engineering at Columbia University on focused ultrasound neuromodulation of the peripheral nervous systems. Here, I was exploring questions such as "How can ultrasound be used to stimulate our nerves?" and "How can this technology be used to treat neuropathic pain?".

## Current Research
- Building open-source computational simulation packages for ultrasound localization microscopy.
- Developing capillary biomarkers, <u>S</u>ingle <u>Ca</u>pillary <u>Re</u>porters (SCaRe), as a readout of brain health.
- Investigating neurovascular dynamics in stroke and pain.

###### Open-source projects can be found [here](https://github.com/stephenalexanderlee) and my photos or prints are available upon request.
